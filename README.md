# Blockchain-Wallet

Our work at a startup that is building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, we have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable your customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.

In this Project, we will complete the code that enables your customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals. To develop the code and test it out, we will assume the perspective of a Fintech Finder customer who is using the application to find a fintech professional and pay them for their work.
